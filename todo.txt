THE GAME JAM TODO LIST:

Click skills to earn them
Fonts
Sounds

Fix bugs
Test on phone/website
Move to gigalixir
Pack some spritesheets
Test performance
Look into limiting DB hits from server
Look into limiting server hits from client
Constrain skill dragging / maybe adjust mask to look not bad / just add a grab handle below icons maybe
Implement chop speed passive skill effects
Tighten start bounds
Clear DB
Turn off cheats


-- Cutting for demo ? -- 
Skill trees
Stroke/glow for when a skill is purchasable
Implement Beacon & Oven (chop speed building)

Place people algorithmically
Implement passive tracking skill effects
Implement passive aura skill effects
Implement emote skill effects
Change wood resource graphic
Implement chopdash skill effects
Popups (for tutorials and such)
Visual clues for effects
Implement skill replacement??



 THE BIG LIST OF TODO:

 Skill tree
  Brainstorm some skills
*** Builder */
    The ability to build at all
    More build options / better versions of buildings
*** Gatherer */
    Chop faster
    Chop dash
    Collect alternative mats in addition to traditional
*** Leader */
    Tracking (find players/buildings off screen)
    Ability to emote (or other limited forms of communication)
    Other nearby players gain benefits (chop, buildspd, buildcost, etc)
  Design idea: Spreading into other archetypes trees costs MORE points, instead of all early branches being cheap.
    More like D&D multiclassing than UO 30%-in-a-ton-of-skills style
  Input method to choose new skills
 Buildings
  Propagate/manage effects (probably server side handling. Imagine buildings go in a list of 'active' things that send out heartbeat effects to nearby players. Will need to add an update loop to the server though.)
    Generate non-wood resources
    Beacon
    AoE effects (faster walk, chop, collection amount)
 Non-permanence?

 Maybe move to gigalixir
 Algo to place players nearby but not too nearby
 Automatic size to fit device
 Sound
 Log in/Character creation
  Let people put their names in (and add jack to all of them)
  Let people choose their color
 Fonts
Share inventory

 Loading screen
 Wake up anim
 Reverse wake up anim
 Propagate swing anim to other clients
 Interesting sights to see
 Log on blurbs

 Real Low Priority:
 Version numbers to ensure client and server are on the same page.
 BUG?? If the player moves too fast the server can't respond with trees? No idea. Seems real fast movement cause the missing tree line bug.
 Need to store some of this data on the server "live" instead of hitting the DB constantly.
 Need to find a way to split up regions on the server so that every active building and player isn't getting all info from each other all the time.
 Update origin points for trees and gobbos so that they match their 'feet'.
 Only send network traffic to nearby duders
 How to split load across multiple servers?
 Chop anim happens when gobbo is already inside tree most of the time. Need to forward detect against movement. 
 User authentication
 This could probably be in a 'main.js' instead of index.js, but who the fuck really cares
 Gonna need to move to sprite sheets at some time probably.

 ======================================= DESIGN SHIT =========================================
 Skill tree is actual tree
 Skills allow player to cut faster, build faster, build with less materials, buildings live longer after log off
 Player's accomplishments in a given session affect how much xp gained per hour while logged off (or how many hours xp is gained for)
 Perhaps there are multiple skill trees found randomly, and you have to chop down a skill tree
  to gain a new skill

 Alternative design: Trees do not grow back (but buildings still decay?)
  Players always given a mysterious unexplained compass needle

 Bonuses for meeting/participating with other players?
 Perhaps some buildings require multiple players to work together to build
 Buildings don't show up in build list until available: Create some unknowns for players to discover

 Maybe player created buildings turn into ruins and become the interesting things other players find later


 Buildings cut for the demo
  Brainstorm some building effects
    Trade wood for non-wood resources
    Clear large swath of surrounding forest
    Increase XP gain
    Flags/Direction markers
    AoE effects (faster walk, chop, collection amount)
    Skill tree equivalent (if skill trees are rare objects to find)
    Fast travel between points
    Anchor (adds permanence or semipermanence to other buildings)
    Roads - faster walking, long duration

 Skills cut for the demo
  Brainstorm some skills
*** Builder */
    Build faster
    Build for cheaper
    Using one resource for another (at heavy cost)
*** Gatherer */
    Collect more mats from doing things
    Stump grinding - turn stumps into extra materials sometimes
    Walk faster
    Teleport
*** Leader */
    Guiding light, other players will occasionally get a radar beep for your character
    Log in closer to other players
    Jump to player
*** Settler */
    Buildings last longer
    Chopped trees stay down longer
    Body lasts longer (or shorter?) before fading after log off
    Small chance to log in to the same spot you logged out at
    Upgrade buildings to new tiers
*** Dreamer */
    Able to see other player's ghosts after their bodies have faded
    Able to send a push notification to another nearby player immediately after the log off (so they could log back on and meet up)
    |-> And able to pull player back to the place they logged out
    Able to see a brief beacon when another player logs off within a certain distance
